# Ball-Tower-Cllimber
“Ball Tower Climber” is an endless 2D platform game where the player controls a ball that automatically jumps while moving it left and right to land on platforms. The goal is to climb as high as possible while avoiding falling. Platforms are procedurally generated, including normal, moving, shrinking, or breakable types, creating an endless and varied challenge. Players can unlock and purchase permanent upgrades in a menu, which can be toggled on or off, and switch between different ball transformations using a dedicated button. Examples of balls include a Beach Ball that bounces higher but is affected by wind, a Rubber Ball with slightly sticky landings for precision, and a Golf Ball that is small enough to fit in tight spaces that other balls cannot.
